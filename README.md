Start script then wander around wildy while playing manually. 

If a PKer is detected, script unpauses, changes Mouse speed to 100%, then spams logout. Once logged out script stops. Restart script to login to account and unpause again to detect more pkers.

A PKer is defined as anyone else in the wilderness with you that is within your level bracket (attackable in wildy) + 1 lvl and who is within a 15-tile square radius around you.
